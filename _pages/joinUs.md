<b>For current or prospective Ph.D. students</b>: If you are interested in joining me as a Ph.D. student, please send me an email (wangty_AT_bu.edu) with your CV and publication/project list. There are domain-specific skills that influence which tracks you will specialize in:

* Computational track: You're keen on learning programming and machine learning to solve scientific problems. This often requires substantial coding, a basic understanding of computer hardware, crafting your own solutions, and lots of debugging. 
* Optical instrumentation track: You enjoy the process of overcoming challenges in optical experiments, which typically involve meticulous handling of sensitive instruments, effective planning and time management, and a lot of trial and error to get things to work.
* Biomedical track: You're drawn to specific biological questions (e.g., in neuroscience, immunology, or genomics) that can be studied through optical imaging, with an aim to showcase your technology in real biological experiments. 
However, no matter you are more experimental or computational oriented, learning skills from the other side will significantly accelerate your research progress and enrich your scientific career.

If you plan to apply to a Ph.D. program that starts in Fall 2024, you can consider applying to [ECE Ph.D. program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-electrical-engineering/) (in electrophysics track) and/or [BME Ph.D. Program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/) at Boston University. Both deadlines are <u>December 15, 2023</u>. As a Ph.D. student in these programs, your tuition will be waived, and you will receive a stipend for your research or teaching activities ([BME PhD handbook](https://www.bu.edu/eng/files/2023/10/BME-PhD-Handbook-Fall-2023.pdf)). There are also several graudate fellowship programs available for BU students to apply to ([Photonics Center](https://www.bu.edu/photonics/prt/benefits-of-a-photonics-center-phd-trainee/); ).

A unique benefit of attending Boston University is its [strategic location](/contact/), which provides you with unparalleled access to academic resources, networking opportunities, and cultural enrichment.

  <summary>A word on why pursuing a Ph.D. and what to expect</summary>
  A proper motivation for getting a Ph.D. is to develop one's scholarship as an independent researcher. A time-tested way to accomplish this goal is through conducting an original study/project, complemented by tailored guidance. You will likely maximize your gain through this journey if some of the followings describe you:

1. Scientific motivation: You are intrigued by a certain class of scientific problems and have the desire to create your own artifact (methods, discoveries, invention, or theory). 
1. Research instinct: You understand the open-ended nature of research, and are willing to master the art of navigating uncertainties, using literature, discussion, and independent thinking as your guide.
1. Input skills: You enjoy keeping up with the latest research trends in your field by consistently browsing papers and attending relevant talks.
1. Output skills: You wish to develop writing and presentation skills to effectively communicate your findings and ideas to the scientific community and the broader audience. 
1. Teamwork skills: You thrive in a collaborative environment, valuing knowledge-sharing, learning from feedback (from peers, superiors, and subordinates alike), and close collaborations with colleagues to achieve objectives that might be challenging to tackle solo.
