<b>For current or prospective Ph.D. students</b>: If you are interested in joining me as a Ph.D. student, please [reach out to me](/contact/) and a list of your publications or projects. My lab is built on the unique synergies of the following three research areas. Typically, students are encouraged to first specialize in one area, and then expand to the others based on their career development needs:

* <u>Photonics</u>: You enjoy the process of overcoming challenges in experiments, which typically involves careful experimental design and planning, meticulous handling of sensitive instruments, and a lot of troubleshooting to get things to work. Prior experience with either free-space optics or nanophotonics is a plus.
* <u>Computation</u>: You're keen on learning programming and machine learning to solve scientific problems, which involves in-depth understanding of the underlying scientific problem and lots of coding and debugging. Prior experience in Python and training of state-of-the-art machine-learning models is a plus.
* <u>Biomedicine</u>: You're drawn to specific biological questions (e.g., in neuroscience, immunology, or genomics) that can be best studied by optical imaging. You wish to develop new technologies to solve real biological problems. Exposure to a specific area of biological research is a plus.

If you plan to apply to a Ph.D. program that starts in Fall 2024, you can consider applying to [ECE Ph.D. program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-electrical-engineering/) (in electrophysics track) and/or [BME Ph.D. Program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/) at Boston University. Both deadlines are <b>December 15, 2023</b>. When applying, you will need to indicate labs that you are interested in doing a rotation with during your first year. If you choose to rotate in my lab, you'll work on a technical project that exercises both your experimental and computational skills. Keep in mind that this rotation project could evolve into, or inspire, a full Ph.D. thesis.

As a Ph.D. student in ECE or BME, your tuition is covered by BU, and you also receive a stipend for your research or teaching activities ([ECE PhD handbook](https://www.bu.edu/eng/files/2022/09/ECE.PhD_.Handbook.pdf); [BME PhD handbook](https://www.bu.edu/eng/files/2023/10/BME-PhD-Handbook-Fall-2023.pdf)). Meanwhile, you are strongly encouraged to apply to internal and external graduate fellowships ([Photonics Center](https://www.bu.edu/photonics/prt/benefits-of-a-photonics-center-phd-trainee/); p.10 in the [ECE PhD handbook](https://www.bu.edu/eng/files/2022/09/ECE.PhD_.Handbook.pdf)). A unique benefit of attending Boston University is its [strategic location](/contact/), which provides you with unparalleled access to academic resources, networking opportunities, and cultural enrichment.

  <summary> <u>A word on why pursuing a Ph.D. and what to expect</u></summary>

  A proper motivation for getting a Ph.D. degree is to develop one's scholarship as an independent researcher, a quality that is required for academic positions and certain kinds of industry positions. A time-tested way to accomplish this goal is through conducting an original study under tailored guidance. A Ph.D. thesis typically aims to address questions that can result in surprising discoveries, and its success relies on close collaboration between the student, the advisor, and other colleagues. You will likely maximize your gain through this journey if some of the followings describe you:
  <ol>
  <li>Scientific motivation: You are intrigued by a certain class of scientific problems and have the desire to create your own artifact (methods, discoveries, invention, or theory). </li>
  <li>Research instinct: You understand the open-ended nature of research, and are willing to master the art of navigating uncertainties, using literature, discussion, and independent thinking as your guide.</li>
  <li>Input skills: You enjoy keeping up with the latest research trends in your field by consistently browsing papers and attending relevant talks.</li>
  <li>Output skills: You wish to develop writing and presentation skills to effectively communicate your findings and ideas to the scientific community and the broader audience. </li>
  <li>Teamwork skills: You thrive in a collaborative environment, valuing knowledge-sharing, learning from feedback (from peers, superiors, and subordinates alike), and close collaborations with colleagues to achieve objectives that might be challenging to tackle solo.</li>
  </ol>
