Welcome to <span style="color: #cc0000;">Tianyu Wang Research Group</span> in the Department of Electical and Computer Engineering at Boston University!

We are interested in studying forms of information processing mechanisms that can plausibly exist in natural and artificial systems. By re-examining the connection between physics and computing, we can obtain insights on how to engineer better computing, sensing, and imaging systems that maximally extracts the intrinsic computing power from physical processes. This principle has led to <span style="color: #cc0000;">optical processors</span> and <span style="color: #cc0000;">neuromorphic processors/sensors</span> that are faster and more energy efficient than traditional systems solely based on digital electronics.
