Welcome to <span style="color: #cc0000;">Tianyu Wang Research Group</span> in the Department of Electical and Computer Engineering at Boston University!

We are interested in studying various forms of information processing mechanisms that can plausibly exist in natural and artificial systems. By re-examining physics through the prespective of computing, we gain insights on how to engineer computing, sensing, and imaging systems that can maximally extract the intrinsic computing power from their consituent physical parts. These principles help us to make <span style="color: #cc0000;">optical processors</span> and <span style="color: #cc0000;">neuromorphic computing/sensing</span> that are faster and more energy efficient than traditional systems based solely on digital electronics.
