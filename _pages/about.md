Welcome to <span style="color: #cc0000;">Tianyu Wang Research Group</span> in the Department of Electical and Computer Engineering at Boston University!

We are interested in studying various forms of information processing mechanisms that can plausibly exist in natural and artificial systems. By re-examining physics through the prespective of computing, we gain insights on how to improve the engineering of computing, sensing, and imaging systems by maximally extracting the intrinsic computing power from their consituent physical parts. Some examples include <span style="color: #cc0000;">optical computing</span> and <span style="color: #cc0000;">neuromorphic computing/sensing</span>, which help us to make processors and sensors that are faster and more energy efficient than traditional systems based solely on digital electronics.
