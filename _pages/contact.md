<b>For current or prospective Ph.D. students</b>: If you are interested in joining me as a Ph.D. student, please send me an email (wangty_AT_bu.edu) with your CV and publication list. You will be a good fit if <i>some</i> of the following describe you:

1. Scientific motivation: You are intrigued by a certain class of scientific problems and have the desire to create your own artifact (methods, discoveries, invention, or theory). 
1. Research instinct: You embrace the open-ended nature of research, and are willing to master the art of navigating uncertainties, using literature, discussion, and independent thinking as your guide.
1. Input skills: You enjoy keeping up with the latest research trends in your field by consistently browsing papers and attending relevant talks.
1. Output skills: You wish to develop writing and presentation skills to effectively communicate your findings and ideas to the scientific community and the broader audience. 
1. Teamwork skills: You thrive in a collaborative environment, valuing knowledge-sharing, learning from feedback (from peers, superiors, and subordinates alike), and close collaborations with colleagues to achieve objectives that might be challenging to tackle solo.

In addition to general qualities, there are domain-specific skills that influence which tracks you will specialize in:

* Computational track: You're keen on mastering programming and machine learning to address scientific challenges. This often requires substantial coding, a basic understanding of computer hardware, crafting your own solutions, and lots of debugging. 
* Optical instrumentation track: You enjoy the process of overcoming challenges in optical experiments, which typically involve meticulous handling of sensitive instruments, effective planning and time management, and a lot of trial and error to get things to work.
* Biomedical track: You're drawn to specific biological queries that can be studied through optical imaging. Whether you're already an expert or just starting out, you aim to showcase how your technological approach can elucidate real biological problems through hands-on experiments.

However, no matter you are more experimental or computational oriented, learning skills from the other side will significantly facilitate your career and enhance your research outcomes. 

If you plan to apply to a Ph.D. program that starts in Fall 2024, you can consider applying to [ECE Ph.D. program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-electrical-engineering/) (in electrophysics track) and/or [BME Ph.D. Program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/) at Boston University. Both deadlines are <u>December 15, 2023</u>. 

<b>For prospective postdocs</b>: I currently have one open position for postdoc. Please contact me as long as you are interested in our research topics.
