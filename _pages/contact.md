<b>For current Ph.D. students</b>: If you wish to join me as a Ph.D. student or a postdoc, please send me an email with your CV and publication list. 
You are suitable for this lab if some of the following describe you:

1. You are fascinated by certain scientific questions or have the ambition to create your own technical invention (Please tell me what drives you, if possible.).
1. You are comfortable with the open-ended nature of research, and can effectively utilize literature, discussions, and other resources to chart a way forward.
1. You are eager to pick up programming and machine learning skills for solving scientific problems, which typically involve a fair amount of coding, some understanding of computer hardware, searching for solutions that do not yet exist, and lots of debugging.
1. You enjoy the challenge of optical experiments, which typically involve high-power lasers, careful handling of delicate objects, patience with funky equipment and other human beings, and lots of trial and error to get things to work.
1. (Bonus) You are interested in certain biological questions that can be studied by optical imaging (or already an expert in a field), and are adventruous enough for biological experiments.
