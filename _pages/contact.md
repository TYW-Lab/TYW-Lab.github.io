<b>For current or prospective Ph.D. students</b>: If you are interested in joining me as a Ph.D. student, please send me an email (wangty_AT_bu.edu) with your CV and publication list. You will be a good fit if some of the following describe you:

1. You are fascinated by certain scientific questions and have the desire to create your own artifact (theory, methods, discoveries, or invention). 
1. You are comfortable with the open-ended nature of research, and can effectively utilize literature, discussions, and other resources to chart a way forward.
1. You are eager to learn programming and machine learning skills, and use them to solve scientific problems, which typically involve a fair amount of coding, some understanding of computer hardware, coming up with solutions that do not yet exist, and lots of debugging.
1. You enjoy overcoming challenges in optical experiments, which typically involve careful handling of delicate instrument, taming funky equipment, planning and time management, and lots of trial and error to get things to work.
1. You are interested in certain biological questions that can be studied by optical imaging (or already an expert in that field), and are adventruous enough for biological experiments. 
1. You are interested in horning your writing skills to better convey your thoughts and discoveries to the scientific community or beyond. 
1. You enjoy working in a team, sharing your knowledge and learning from others (including your peers, seniors, and juniors).

If you have not applied to a Ph.D. program yet, you may consider applying to [ECE Ph.D. program](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-electrical-engineering/) (in electrophysics concetrantion) and [BME Ph.D. Program] (https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/explore-degree-programs/phd-in-biomedical-engineering/). Both deadlines are December 15, 2023.
