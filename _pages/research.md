Physical systems have triple identities: they can be abstracted as physics, dynamical systems, or information processing systems, or all of the three at the same time. Historically, the discussion of computational properties of physical systems have been historically restricted to digital computing models, and only until recently, their computational capacity as neural networks has been realized. Neural networks, or more broadly neuromorphic computing models, do not rely on digital computing to function, but can intrinsically work with analog values and noise, making them suitable for describing the computational processes taking place in a vast variety of analog physical systems, including optical system. By taking a fresh angle to look at
