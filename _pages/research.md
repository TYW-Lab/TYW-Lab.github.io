Welcome to the Tianyu Wang research group in the Department of Electical and Computer Engineering at Boston University!

We are interested in understanding various forms of information processing mechanisms existing in natural and artificial systems. By re-examining physics through the prespective of computing, we aim to improve the engineering of computing, sensing, and imaging systems by maximally extracting the intrinsic computing power from their consituent physical parts. Some examples include <span style="color: #cc0000;">optical computing</span> and <span style="color: #cc0000;">neuromorphic computing/sensing</span>, which leads to processors and sensors that are faster and more energy efficient than traditional systems based purely on digital electronics.

Physical systems have triple identities: they can be abstracted as physics, dynamical systems, or information processing systems, or all of the three at the same time. Historically, the discussion of computational properties of physical systems have been restricted to digital computing models, and only until recently, it is realized that it may be more natural to describe them as artificial neural networks, which are intrisically analog computing models that work extremely well with noise. This new perspective provides us with a new angle to approach problems in the area of optical imaging, sensing, and computing, which can potentially lead to new technologies, such as neuromorphic processors and smart sensors, that are faster and more energy efficient than current technologies.
