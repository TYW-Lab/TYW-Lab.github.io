            Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in a resurgence of interest in developing photonic neural networks for more efficient machine-learning computation. AI and photonic computing form a nice synergy since neural-network models, especially large ones, bring the best out of optical processors by emphasizing the strength of optics for data transmission and reuse. Most significantly, they represent a class of analog computing systems that have been experimentally shown to approach the physical limit of computation, by using even single photons for each operation. We are interested in using photonic neural networks as a testbed to study novel computing phenomena in this analog noisy regime.

            Another opportunity offered by photonic neuromorphic computing is its potential for making smarter and more effcient sensors. Unlike computational imaging, whose goal is to produce full-resolution images through computational reconstruction, the primary goal of image sensing is to capture salient features with a high precision and speed beyond traditional hardware. This performance is achieved by breaking the wall between traditional imaging, sensing, and computing modules and strategically offloading some computation to optics and sensors. This holistic approach allows us to train the entire machine-vision system in an end-to-end fashion for specific machine-vision tasks, allowing a synergy otherwise unattainable by optimizing individual parts for different objectives. Getting results without bookkeeping all the intermediate data is a neuromorphic design principle, which is ubiquitously adopted by biological organisms and autonomous systems to perform tasks in real time. We are interested in demonstrating the impact of this computational sensing scheme by using it to solve real-world problems in high-speed robotics and high-throughput biomedical assays.

## <span style="color: #cc0000;"> Imaging and Sensing with Quantum Light </span> ##

        <div class="columntext">
            Quantum and other non-classical states of light are enticing for imaging and sensing applications, as each photon in such states can potentially carry more information than photons in classical light states. This is because quantum resources, such as entanglement, allow us to engineer the collective behavior of multiple photons, which provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve various forms of quantum imaging or sensing advantages beyong classical light, such as enhanced resolution or phase measurement precision. However, many questions remain open: Can we engineer a state of light that can lead to scalable quantum sensing advantage? How about in presence of loss and background noise? Can we engineer a bright enough light source to achieve unconditional quantum sensing advantages? In the context of optical microscopy and image sensing, we are interested in developing systems and computational methods for achieving practical quantum sensing advantages with light.

            Despite the advancements in artificial intelligence, the working principle of its source of inspiration &mdash; biological neural networks &mdash; is still not elucidated. The difficulty comes in two folds, it is both challenging to measure and to analyze neural activity data. We are interested in helping with this endeavor in two ways:
            <ol> 
                <li> <u>Seeing through light scattering</u>: While optical imaging provides a minimally invasive means to measure the activities of biological neurons across a large population, imaging through turbid biological tissue is challenging due to the highly complex and dynamical nature of tissue-induced light scattering. We are interested in exploring ways to instantly de-scatter light through a mixture of physics and AI methods. Combined with state-of-the-art optical microscopy or spectroscopy, these methods will enable us to substantially push the depth of brain imaging.</li>
                <li> <u>Understanding neuronal activity data</u>: To test if the information in current large-scale neuronal recording dataset contains sufficient information for modeling circuit-level functions, we will explore state-of-the-art AI models for neuronal data analysis.</li>
