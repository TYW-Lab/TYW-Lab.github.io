            Another opportunity offered by photonic neuromorphic computing is to make smarter and more effcient sensors. Unlike computational imaging, whose goal is to produce a full-resolution image through computational reconstruction, the goal of image sensing concerns capturing salient features with high precision and speed that is otherwise unattainable by traditional hardware. This performance is achieved by breaking the wall between conventional imaging and computing modules, but instead strategically offloading some computation to optics as an optical neural network. This holistic approach allows us to train the entire machine-vision system in an end-to-end fashion for a single purpose, achieving a global optimum otherwise not obtained by optimizing each individual parts. Getting the result without saving the intermediate data is a ubiquitous neuromorphic design principle, and is required by biological organisms and autonomous systems to perform tasks in real time. We are interested in demonstrating the impact of this computational sensing scheme for real-world applications in robotics and biomedical assays.

            Compared to classical light, quantum and other engineered states of light are enticing for imaging and sensing purposes since each photon of these states can carry more information than its classical counterpart. This advantage can translate to more sensitive measurements and higher imaging resolution; however, many open questions still remain: example, can we engineer a state of light that can lead to scalable quantum sensing advantage? Can we engineer a bright enough light source to achieve unconditional quantum sensing advantage? How about being also robust to loss and background noise? We are interested researching the hardware and methods for achieving quantum sensing advantages with optics.

            Despite the advancements in artificial intelligence, the work principle of its source of inspiration -- biological neural network -- is still not elucidated. While optical imaging provides a high-throughput method to measure biological neuronal activities, imaging through biological tissue is challenging due to the highly complex and dynamical nature of tissue-induced light scattering. Our obsesstion with optical information may present the key to solving this problem by allowing us to maximally extract information from back-scattered photons either to learn about the tissue structure or to compensate for the scattering.
