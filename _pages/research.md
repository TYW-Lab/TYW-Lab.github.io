We are interested in studying information processing in physical systems, especially in optical and biological systems. By studying how physics computes, we hope to inspire the development of new principles, algorithms, and hardware for imaging, sensing, and computing.

Physical systems have triple identities: they can be abstracted as physics, dynamical systems, or information processing systems, or all of the three at the same time. Historically, the discussion of computational properties of physical systems have been restricted to digital computing models, and only until recently, it is realized that it may be more natural to describe them as artificial neural networks, which are intrisically analog computing models that work extremely well with noise. This new perspective provides us with a new angle to approach problems in the area of optical imaging, sensing, and computing, which can potentially lead to new technologies, such as neuromorphic processors and smart sensors, that are faster and more energy efficient than current technologies.
