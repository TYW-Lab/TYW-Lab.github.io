In this lab, we will develop novel systems, methods, and applications for optical imaging, sensing, and computing, through the lens of treating physical systems as computing systems.

Physical systems have triple identities: they can be abstracted as physics, dynamical systems, or information processing systems, or all of the three at the same time. Historically, the discussion of computational properties of physical systems have been restricted to digital computing models, and only until recently, it is realized that it may be more natural to describe them as artificial neural networks, which are intrisically analog computing models that work extremely well with noise. This new perspective provides us with a new angle to approach problems in the area of optical imaging, sensing, and computing, which can potentially lead to new technologies, such as neuromorphic processors and smart sensors, that are faster and more energy efficient than current technologies.

More detailed research quesetions and cases coming up soon!
